Kudos to libopencm3 for all those register definition!
For convenience CRANC (https://github.com/nerdmaennchen/CRANC) is utilized here to speed up the software development process and render the code more readable.

Most of the code should be pretty self explanatory; and thanks to CRANC there isn't much code to speak of!
